#### From the musical bow of Tacuabé to the creation of new worlds.

On February 25th, 1833, a ship set sail for France with 33 people on board, including four indigenous individuals: Guyunusa, the shaman Senaqué, the Charrúa chief Vaimaca Perú, the young Tacuabé, and Tacuabé's musical bow, a monochord chordophone that he had built himself. With this instrument, he played ternary rhythms, producing "sweet and harmonious sounds". According to documents from the time, the instrument was capable of reproducing an octave, and within this range, Tacuabé's musical bow could produce an infinite number of notes, since it is a tempered instrument capable of obtaining even the smallest subdivisions of tone. In reality, Tacuabé's musical bow is a chordophone that is present in various cultures across all continents. References to this instrument can be found in Europe as early as the year 1000, and examples of it can also be found in Oceania, Africa, and throughout the Americas.

Recent studies in the field of Archaeoastronomy indicate that Charrúa communities, as well as ethnographic groups of South American indigenous peoples such as Mapuches, Tehuelches, and Patagonian Indians, have a strong identification with certain celestial elements in their mythology and cosmogony, which is reflected in their architectural constructions and integration with the landscape. Like many other cultures, especially non-Western cultures, they had a way of belonging to the landscape that was not limited to the physical plane, a worldview that included multiple planes, such as the underworld and the sky. The Sun, the Moon, Venus, the stars, the mountains, the hills, the stones, the caves, the clouds, the rain, the earth, the sea, the rivers, the lagoons, the flora, and the fauna were all part of the ritual landscape of the ancient pre-Hispanic peoples.
