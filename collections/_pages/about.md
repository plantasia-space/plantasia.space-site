  <p>Maar World Records is a home for Regenerative Music, developing new formats by merging physical and digital releases, music creation, and listening. The project aims to establish the pillars of a conscious music ecosystem that safeguards life and ensures fair and harmonious recognition for artists, developers, and investors. We are currently developing the Interplanetary Players to promote an intuitive and playful approach to sound creation and listening; these music tools focus on encouraging movement, reducing anxiety, improving mood and memory, and creating the context for self-healing.</p>


<h4> Founder </h4>

  <p>My name is 𝐵𝓇𝓊𝓃𝒶 𝑀𝒶𝒶𝓇 𝒢𝓊𝒶𝓇𝓃𝒾𝑒𝓇𝒾 𝒞𝑜𝓁𝒶𝓈𝓈𝑜, I am a sound artist and engineer who works on transdisciplinary creations at the intersection of art, science, and technology. After studying Sound Design and Engineering in Montevideo and Santiago de Chile, I collaborated with sound and interaction design on many experiences including large-scale installations in America and Europe. Some highlights are the 2021 AI and Music S+T+ARTS Festival Hackathon award, the sound design of the Uruguayan Pavilion at the Venice Architecture Biennale 2021 and 2018 and the Uruguayan and Chilean Pavilion at the Milan Expo 2015, I was also lead developer in the artist-run initiatives <a href="http://headbrothers.com" rel="Head Brothers Home Page" target="_blank">Head Brothers</a>, <a href="http://headbrothers.com/exoplanetas" rel="Exoplanetas Page" target="_blank">Exoplanetas</a> and Aventures Sonores. For more than a decade, I have been assembling a unique archive of soundscapes, poetry, testimonies, native South American chants, radio signals, and a selection of eclectic music to create experiences that connect people and cultures through sound.</p>

  <q> When we manage to free ourselves from the dominance of the visual-analytical world and replace it with intuition and sensation, we begin to rediscover the true tuning of the world and the exquisite harmony of all its voices. 
  We will find the center. Then the whole body will become an ear and all sounds will come to you, the known and the unknown, the sweet, the sad and the urgent. 
  When my body lies in bed white and blue at night, all sounds come to me from their own chord, unhurried, strangely mixed, the slightly tonal and the soft creaks of the mountains. 
  At that moment, to hear is to be on high alert... and I hear songs in front of me... when I go beyond "to the country that loves silence". </q>
