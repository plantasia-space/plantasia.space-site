card_description: Recognizing the intrinsic link between the well-being of aquatic species and ecosystems and the economy, the inhabitants of this world have developed a dedicated currency that sustains the delicate balance of life in the planet's waterways. The tax paid on every transaction goes directly to the world's regeneration, nourishing and sustaining the delicate balance of life in the oceans, rivers, and inhabitants. It is a unique system, one that recognizes the inherent value of nature and the importance of preserving it for future generations. It is a currency that speaks to the soul of the planet and the spirit of its people.
