card_description: The connection between sound and the physical environment is understood as a reflection of the present moment. The sounds that reach one's ear are not just background noise, but a manifestation of the state of the environment. The gentle flow of a stream, the crashing of ocean waves, and the songs of birds all hold information about the natural world. By listening attentively, one can gain insight into the present moment and the state of the environment. The sound of the land is not only to be respected and protected, but also to be used as a tool for understanding and connection to the natural world. The beauty and diversity of soundscapes can offer a deeper understanding of the present, the laws of physics and the natural cycles of the environment.
