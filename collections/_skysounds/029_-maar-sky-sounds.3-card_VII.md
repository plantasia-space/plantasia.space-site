card_description: There exists a species with the extraordinary ability to perceive beyond the physical realm. They possess a heightened sensitivity to the subatomic realm, allowing them to see beyond the limitations of human perception. This ability is rooted in the training of their neural structure, which enables them to detect and process information beyond the typical range of human senses. They use this ability to study and understand the underlying laws of physics, delving deeper into the secrets of the multiverse. They usually are scientists, explorers, and philosophers, constantly pushing the boundaries of knowledge.
