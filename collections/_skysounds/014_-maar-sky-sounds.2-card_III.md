card_description: Creatures from the sky, with voices as sweet as a songbird's, grace the land of Maar with their presence. They descend from the heavens, singing melodies that echo through the valleys and across the mountains. They are a reminder of the beauty and mystery of the natural world, and their songs are a call to all who hear them to come closer and listen. For the inhabitants of Maar, the creatures from the sky represent a connection to the divine and a connection to the beauty of the natural world. Their songs are a call to action.
